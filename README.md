# Conway's Game of Life on the Onion Omega 2+

This is a fun little experiment to run Conway's Game of Life on an [Onion Omega 2+](https://onion.io/omega2/).

It uses the Python code from [KieranP's Game Of Life Implementations](https://github.com/KieranP/Game-Of-Life-Implementations).

We've got a video of it in action [over here on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thatpatrickguy/status/1252559479947751431). We did a bit of coding for this together live on the [Dev Diner Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/devdiner).
